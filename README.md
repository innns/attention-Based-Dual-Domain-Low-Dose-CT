# attention-Based-Dual-Domain-Low-Dose-CT
this paper introduces a new sparse-view CT reconstruction method that combines a lightweight convolutional interpolation network with a multi-head attention mechanism. We integrate this network into the dual-domain parallel network architecture, incorporating a dual-domain fusion module based on attention.
